# Blog App

A full-stack MERN Blog Application built using React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT Authentication.
The application supports role-based access for Users, Authors, and Admins. Users can read articles and comment, 
authors can create and manage content, and admins can manage the overall system.

The application integrates frontend and backend services along with MongoDB Atlas and Cloudinary for image storage.

### Overall Summary

This project helped me understand complete MERN stack development by connecting frontend and backend applications into a real-world blog platform.
I learned authentication, role-based access control, API integration, state management, protected routes, file uploads, 
deployment using Vercel and Render, and handling production issues like CORS and environment variables.
